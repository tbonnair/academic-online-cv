abstract: " A regularized version of Mixture Models is proposed to learn a
  principal graph from a distribution of D-dimensional data points. In the
  particular case of manifold learning for ridge detection, we assume that the
  underlying manifold can be modeled as a graph structure acting like a
  topological prior for the Gaussian clusters turning the problem into a maximum
  a posteriori estimation. Parameters of the model are iteratively estimated
  through an Expectation-Maximization procedure making the learning of the
  structure computationally efficient with guaranteed convergence for any graph
  prior in a polynomial time. We also embed in the formalism a natural way to
  make the algorithm robust to outliers of the pattern and heteroscedasticity of
  the manifold sampling coherently with the graph structure. The method uses a
  graph prior given by the minimum spanning tree that we extend using random
  sub-samplings of the dataset to take into account cycles that can be observed
  in the spatial distribution."
