  caption: "Illustration of the training dynamics of a diffusion model. Depending on the training time τ, we identify three regimes measured by the inverse quality of the generated samples (blue curve) and their memorization fraction (red curve). The generalization regime extends over a large window of training times which increases with the training set size n. On top, we show a one dimensional example of the learned score function during training (orange). The gray line gives the exact empirical score, at a given noise level, while the black dashed line corresponds to the true (population) score. </p>
