abstract: The late-time matter distribution depicts a complex pattern commonly
  called the cosmic web. In this picture, the spatial arrangement of matter is
  that of dense anchors, the nodes, linked together by elongated bridges of
  matter, the filaments, found at the intersection of thin mildly-dense walls,
  themselves surrounding large empty voids. This distribution, shaped by
  gravitational forces since billions of years, carries crucial information on
  the underlying cosmological model and on the evolution of the large-scale
  structures. Detecting and studying elements of cosmic web, playing also a key
  role in the formation and evolution of galaxies, are challenging tasks
  requiring the elaboration of optimised methods to handle the intrinsic
  complexity of the pattern made of multi-scale structures of various shapes and
  densities.With the aim of identifying and characterising the cosmic web
  environments, we propose several approaches to analyse spatially structured
  point-cloud datasets, not restricted to cosmological ones, by means of
  unsupervised machine learning methods based on mixture models. In particular,
  we use principles emanating from statistical physics to get a better
  understanding of the learning dynamics of a clustering algorithm and expose
  how statistical physics can be used to explore the data distribution and
  obtain key insights on its structure.In order to identify the filamentary part
  of the pattern, its most prominent feature, we propose a regularisation of the
  clustering procedure to iteratively learn a non-linear representation of
  structured datasets, assuming it was generated by an underlying
  one-dimensional manifold. The method models this latent structure as a graph
  embedded as a prior in the Bayesian formulation of the problem to estimate a
  principal graph passing in the ridges of the matter distribution as traced by
  galaxies or halos.We show that this formulation is especially well-suited for
  the description of the filaments since it allows the description of their
  geometrical properties (lengths, widths, etc.) and associates to each tracer a
  probability of residing in a given filament. The resulting algorithm is
  successfully used to detect filaments in state-of-the-art numerical
  simulations. It also allows us to study the relation between the connectivity
  of galaxy clusters to the cosmic web and their dynamical and morphological
  properties. Finally, based on a large suite of N-body simulations, we perform
  a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological information content based on the
  two-point statistics derived in the cosmic web environments (nodes, filaments,
  walls and voids). We show that they can break some degeneracies among key
  parameters of the model making them a suitable alternative probe to
  significantly improve the constraints on cosmological parameters obtained by
  standard analyses.
