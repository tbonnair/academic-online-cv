abstract: <p align="justify">Matter distribution around clusters is highly anisotropic because
  clusters are the nodes of the cosmic web. The shape of the clusters and the
  number of filaments to which they are connected, that is, their connectivity,
  is thought to reflect their level of anisotropic matter distribution and must
  in principle be related to their physical properties. We investigate the
  effect of the dynamical state and the formation history on both the morphology
  and local connectivity of about 2400 groups and clusters of galaxies from the
  large hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG at z = 0. We find that the mass
  of groups and clusters mainly affects the geometry of the matter distribution":"
  Massive halos are significantly more elliptical and are more strongly
  connected to the cosmic web than low-mass halos. Beyond the mass-driven
  effect, ellipticity and connectivity are correlated and are imprints of the
  growth rate of groups and clusters. Both anisotropy measures appear to trace
  different dynamical states, such that unrelaxed groups and clusters are more
  elliptical and more connected than relaxed ones. This relation between matter
  anisotropies and dynamical state is the sign of different accretion histories.
  Relaxed groups and clusters have mostly been formed a long time ago and are
  slowly accreting matter at the present time. They are highly spherical and
  weakly connected to their environment, mostly because they had enough time to
  relax and thus lost the connection with their preferential directions of
  accretion and merging. In contrast, late-formed unrelaxed objects are highly
  anisotropic with strong connectivities and ellipticities. These groups and
  clusters are in their formation phase and must be strongly affected by the
  infalling of materials from filaments.</p>

summary: <p align="justify">The way clusters are embedded in the cosmic web is linked with their
  intrinsic structure and dynamics. In this study, we carry an analysis of the
  links between the connectivity, the number of filaments a cluster is connected
  to, and their shape and dynamics (ellipticity, accretion rate etc.). In
  particular, we report a correlation between the connectivity and the assembly
  history of clusters with young and perturbed clusters being more connected
  than the old and relaxed ones.</p>
