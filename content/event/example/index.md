abstract: The spatial distribution of galaxies in the Universe is not uniform
  but rather stands on a gigantic structure commonly called the “cosmic web”. In
  this pattern, dense nodes are linked together by elongated bridges of matter
  named filaments that are playing a key role in the formation and evolution of
  galaxies but also carries information about the cosmological model.In this
  presentation, we build several algorithms aiming at learning patterns in
  point-cloud datasets such as the galaxy distribution. We particularly focus on
  two kinds of patterns, with first clustered-type ones in which the data points
  are separated in the input space into multiple groups. We will show that the
  unsupervised clustering procedure performed with a Gaussian Mixture Model can
  be formulated in terms of a statistical physics optimization problem. This
  formulation enables the unsupervised extraction of much key information about
  the dataset itself, like the number of clusters, their size and how they are
  embedded in space, particularly interesting for high-dimensional input spaces
  where visualization is not possible.On the other hand, we study spatially
  continuous datasets assuming as standing on an underlying 1D structure that we
  aim to learn. To this end, we resort to a regularization of the Gaussian
  Mixture Model in which a spatial graph is used as a prior to approximate the
  underlying 1D structure. The overall graph is efficiently learnt by means of
  the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm with guaranteed convergence and comes
  together with the learning of the local width of the structure.
