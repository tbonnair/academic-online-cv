<p align="justify">I am an interdisciplinary AI researcher hosted at Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale (Orsay, Université Paris-Saclay) bridging physics and AI. I use and adapt tools from theoretical physics to analyse, understand and improve generalization in machine learning models. I also conceive, implement and train AI-based models to solve challenging problems in physics, especially in cosmology and disordered systems. </br> 
Currently? I’m focusing on the theory side on how generalization emerges in diffusion-based models, and in practice on transforming them into powerful tools to study complex and high-dimensional physical systems. Feel free to contact me if you’d like to discuss AI theory, in particular generative models, or their applications in science and beyond. </p>
