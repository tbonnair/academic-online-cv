<p align="justify">I graduated from the french engineering school CentraleSupélec with a major background in applied mathematics and algorithmic. After a year of working as a research engineer in Thales, I decided to begin a Ph.D. program in Université Paris Saclay, at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale, under the supervision of Nabila Aghanim (IAS) and Aurélien Decelle (UCM, LRI). <br>
I am currently an AI Fellow at PSL University in the physics department and Center for Data Sciences of École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris. I am working on the interfaces between statistical physics and theoretical machine learning, but also applications ML methods to physics problems, mainly in cosmology for the study of large-scale matter distribution.</p>
